# Random Fractal Tree Generation
  A fractal tree is a computer-generated tree that starts with a single trunk and branches out into smaller and smaller branches, each resembling the whole tree. The pattern of branches splitting and getting smaller repeats itself, creating a complex, tree-like structure. This repeating pattern, known as self-similarity, mimics natural branching found in real trees and other natural phenomena. Despite using simple rules, fractal trees can produce highly detailed and intricate designs.
